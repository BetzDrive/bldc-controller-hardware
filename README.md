# Betz Drive - A BLDC Controller

This board is designed for low-speed, high torque motor applications that require
highly precise positional and torque commands.

## Features

 * High Precision Current Readings
 
 * 12-bit Precision Positional Readings [AS5047U-HTSM](https://ams.com/documents/20143/36005/AS5047U_DS000637_1-00.pdf)
 
 * Thermal Sensitivity
 
 * Chainable Initialization. Input/output connectors and 'disco-bus' pins provide
 dynamic initialization, allowing for easy replacement of any board (no hard coded ids).
 
 * Optional 20-pin header with 9 GPIO pins, I2C, 3.3V rail, and ground for add-on functionality!
